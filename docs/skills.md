# Skills

Tau discovers Markdown skills at startup, advertises only the small set that should be immediately visible, and lets the agent discover or load the rest with the `skill` tool.


## Discovery

Tau scans skills in priority order:

1. Existing project `.agents/skills` and `.agents.local/skills` directories from the working directory's ancestors, broadest ancestor first and current directory last.
2. `~/.config/agents/skills`
3. `~/.config/agents.local/skills`
4. Legacy `~/.agents/skills`
5. Legacy `~/.agents.local/skills`

When multiple skills use the same name, Tau keeps the candidate with the newest available modification time and reports the conflict as a collision. Skills with readable timestamps beat skills without timestamps. If timestamps are equal or unavailable, the earlier discovered candidate stays selected. User XDG skill roots (`~/.config/agents*`) explicitly beat legacy user skill roots (`~/.agents*`) before modified time is considered. Built-in skills use the harness binary build time as their timestamp, falling back to the executable file mtime when build metadata is unavailable.

Preferred layout:

```text
.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

The frontmatter fields Tau reads are:

- `name`: Optional. Defaults to the parent directory name for `SKILL.md`, or to the file stem for a root-level Markdown skill. Must be lowercase ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens only.
- `description`: Required. Used in prompt advertisements, search results, and loaded skill results.
- `advertise`: Optional. `true`, `True`, `TRUE`, and `1` force prompt advertisement. `false`, `False`, `FALSE`, and `0` force no prompt advertisement. Invalid values warn and use the default.
- `user-invocable`: Optional, default `true`. If false, `/skill` rejects the skill and the terminal completion hides it unless `disable-model-invocation: true` overrides it. This does not block model-side invocation.
- `disable-model-invocation`: Optional, default `false`. If true, Tau excludes the skill from `<available_skills>` and from the model-visible `skill` tool, and treats the skill as user-invocable.
- `argument-hint`: Optional short UI hint shown with `/skill` completion.

Tau ignores `allowed-tools` and other provider-specific permission fields; skill frontmatter does not grant or restrict Tau tool permissions.
Project-scoped skills default to advertised. User-scoped skills default to hidden until searched. `advertise:` overrides the scope default.


## Prompt advertisement

Advertised skills appear in `<available_skills>` with only name and description. Tau does not include the skill body until the agent calls `skill`.

This keeps normal agent context small while still surfacing project-local instructions that are likely relevant immediately.


## User slash invocation

Users can force a skill into the next model prompt with either form:

```text
/skill <name> [arguments...]
/skill:<name> [arguments...]
```

The harness validates the selected discovered skill, rejects unknown or non-user-invocable skills with a visible `harness.notice`, reads the same bounded 64 KiB prefix used by the model-visible tool, strips frontmatter, and expands the submitted prompt to a Pi-style block:

```text
<skill name="..." location="...">
References are relative to ...

...frontmatter-stripped skill body...
</skill>

...opaque arguments, if any...
```

Arguments are append-only text. Tau does not implement placeholder substitution or structured skill arguments.

Terminal `/skill` name completion is currently best-effort over live extension skill announcements; the harness still validates against its canonical selected winner at invocation time. A dedicated harness-owned skill-winner completion snapshot is deferred.

`disable-model-invocation` and `/skill` visibility are prompt-surface controls, not security boundaries. A model with filesystem tools may still read a skill file if it learns the path, and Tau ignores `allowed-tools` as a permission mechanism.

## The `skill` tool

The agent calls `skill` with a `query` string:

```json
{ "query": "rust style" }
```

Tau lowercases and deduplicates query terms. Punctuation separates terms, except hyphens inside skill names are preserved.

Search uses OR semantics: a skill matches if any query term matches its name or description. Hits are sorted by `matched_terms` descending, then by name. `matched_terms` is the number of distinct query terms that matched, not an occurrence count.

By default, Tau does not read skill bodies during search. `search_content: true` also searches the first 64 KiB of the skill file after stripping frontmatter from that prefix.

If the query is unambiguous, Tau returns `name`, `description`, full available `content` with frontmatter stripped, and truncation metadata:

- exactly one matching skill was found; or
- the query has one term and one match has exactly that skill name, even if other skills also matched.

Otherwise Tau returns matching skill names, descriptions, `matched_terms`, `matched_fields`, and guidance. For ambiguous results, the agent should usually call `skill` again with only the exact skill name. If searching again, use a more distinctive term; adding generic terms may not narrow results because search uses OR semantics.


## Size limits

Skill loading and content search read a bounded 64 KiB prefix of each skill file. If loading truncates after frontmatter was closed, Tau returns the available body prefix and marks the result as truncated. If truncation happens before the frontmatter closing fence, Tau errors instead of treating YAML frontmatter as skill body.
