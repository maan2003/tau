# Event interceptors

Event interceptors let a peer handle an event emission before the event is
appended to the harness event log and before normal subscribers see it.

This is a pre-log emission pipeline. While an event is intercepted, it is
considered not emitted yet.

## Events vs messages

There are two protocol layers:

- **Events** are bus facts. They have dotted `category.call` names, are appended
  to the event log when committed, and are delivered to subscribers inside
  `deliver` messages.
- **Messages** are point-to-point protocol traffic. They have flat
  single-component `snake_case` names and are sent between the harness and one
  peer.

Interception is controlled with messages, but it acts on event emissions.

The relevant messages are:

- `intercept` — peer → harness registration request
- `emit` — peer → harness request to publish an event
- `intercept_request` — harness → interceptor delivery of an intercepted,
  not-yet-emitted event
- `intercept_reply` — interceptor → harness decision for that request

The event inside `emit` or `intercept_request` is the fact being processed. The
message itself is not the emitted fact.

## Registering an interceptor

A peer registers interception interest with the `intercept` message.

The message contains:

- `selectors`: event selectors to intercept
  - exact event names
  - prefixes
- `priority`: interception priority

Lower numeric priority values run first.

Registrations are owned by the connection that sent them. When that connection
disconnects or crashes, the harness removes its interceptor registrations. If
the peer reconnects, it must register again during handshake.

## Matching

When the harness is about to commit an event, it checks the interceptor
registry.

Exact selectors are preferred over prefix selectors. This preference is stronger
than priority. For example, an exact interceptor at priority `100` runs before a
prefix interceptor at priority `-100` for the same event.

Within the selected exact or prefix group, handlers are ordered by:

1. priority, ascending; lower values first
2. component name, ascending lexicographic order
3. connection id, ascending, as a final deterministic fallback

Component names are expected to be unique. Runtime enforcement is still TODO.

## Intercept request delivery

If a matching interceptor exists, the harness does not append the event to the
event log and does not deliver it to subscribers yet.

Instead, the harness sends the selected interceptor a directed
`intercept_request` message:

```text
intercept_request {
  event,
  transient
}
```

Fields:

- `event`: the not-yet-emitted event
- `transient`: the persistence flag that will apply when the event commits

This delivery bypasses normal subscriptions. A peer receives intercept requests
because it registered as an interceptor, not because it subscribed to
`intercept_request`. Messages are point-to-point and are not subscribable.

## Interceptor outcomes

An interceptor must reply exactly once with `intercept_reply`.

### Drop

The interceptor can reply with `drop`.

The event is consumed and never reaches later interceptors, the event log, or
normal subscribers. The harness overrides `drop` for must-pass events and
publishes the original event instead. Current default must-pass events include
user input and prompt lifecycle facts; agent response facts
(`provider.response_finished`); terminal tool completion facts (`tool.result`,
`tool.error`, `provider.tool_result`, `provider.tool_error`, `tool.cancelled`,
`tool.background_result`, and `tool.background_error`); `agent.started`; loaded
agent runtime facts; and harness-owned agent message projections. Treat
`crates/tau-harness/src/harness/interception.rs` as the source of truth for that
list. Individual harness call sites can also mark a publish as must-pass, as
mandatory warning/critical `harness.notice` diagnostics do.

### Pass unchanged

The interceptor can reply with `pass` and no replacement event.

The harness resumes the interception chain after the current interceptor, still
using the original event.

### Pass modified

The interceptor can reply with `pass` and a replacement event.

Later interceptors and final subscribers usually see the modified event. The
replacement must have the same event type as the original; if it does not, the
harness logs a warning and falls back to the original event. Some same-type
replacements are also rejected to preserve immutable facts. For mandatory
warning/critical `harness.notice` diagnostics, immutable prompt lifecycle facts,
`provider.response_finished`, terminal tool completion facts, `agent.started`,
loaded agent runtime facts, and harness-owned agent message
projections, the harness publishes the original event instead. For mutable
prompt text events, replacements may edit text but cannot change routing identity
fields such as agent id or prompt metadata. Persistence remains a harness
decision for the final event.

## Same-priority chaining

Suppose the ordered interceptors for an event are:

```text
(priority 10, component alpha)
(priority 10, component beta)
(priority 20, component gamma)
```

Initial emission starts at the beginning, so `alpha` receives the first
`intercept_request`.

If `alpha` replies `pass`, the harness resumes strictly after `(10, alpha)`, so
`beta` receives the next `intercept_request`.

If `beta` replies `pass`, the harness resumes after `(10, beta)`, so `gamma`
receives the next `intercept_request`.

A peer cannot spoof the cursor in its reply. The harness records the pending
interceptor and advances the chain from that connection when the reply arrives.
Unexpected or duplicate replies are ignored.

## Failure and backpressure

Only one intercepted emission is in flight at a time. Publishes that arrive while
an interceptor is pending are queued and drained after the pending interceptor
replies (or disconnects).

If the selected interceptor disconnects before replying, the harness treats that
as `pass` unchanged so an extension cannot wedge the event pipeline by going
away mid-reply. If the harness cannot deliver an `intercept_request` to the
selected interceptor, it logs the failure, removes/skips that interceptor
registration, and continues the chain instead of parking the publish.

## Final emission

If scanning finds no remaining matching interceptor, the harness finally commits
the event normally:

1. apply harness persistence rules
2. append to the harness runtime event log
3. deliver the event to subscribers inside `deliver`

Only this final step makes the event visible as an emitted fact.

## Persistence

Persistence is not part of the peer protocol. The harness decides whether the
final event enters semantic agent history when it commits.

## Debugging

The harness logs interception decisions with tracing under the
`tau_harness::interception` target.

These logs are diagnostic only. They are not event-log entries and are not
visible to normal event subscribers.

## Example flow

A peer registers:

```text
intercept {
  selectors: [Exact("ui.prompt_draft")],
  priority: 0
}
```

Another peer requests emission:

```text
emit {
  event: ui.prompt_draft { ... }
}
```

The harness finds the interceptor and sends it:

```text
intercept_request {
  event: ui.prompt_draft { ... }
}
```

The interceptor modifies the event and passes it on:

```text
intercept_reply {
  action: pass(ui.prompt_draft { modified ... })
}
```

If no later interceptor matches, the modified `ui.prompt_draft` event is
committed and delivered normally.
