# Event log reference

The tau bus mostly carries facts: components broadcast what happened, while the
`ui.*` category carries user-intent requests from attached UIs to the harness.
Every event has a dotted name `<category>.<call>` and a typed payload defined in
`crates/tau-proto/src/events.rs`. This selected guide groups the core events by
component (or class of component) that emits them; `events.rs` is the exhaustive
source of truth for every current first-party wire event.

Events are distinct from **messages**: messages are point-to-point protocol
traffic (handshake, subscribe/intercept, `emit`, `deliver`, etc.) and never
appear on the bus or in durable semantic logs. Events are not top-level wire
items; peers send them inside `emit` and receive them inside `deliver`. See
[messages.md](messages.md) for the message-side reference.
Tool registration payloads now include neutral `tags`, and provider model metadata includes model capability `tags`; these are protocol data used by the harness to decide the effective prompt tool surface.

A few categories don't map to a single emitter — those are grouped by the
class of function that raises them.

## Harness (general)

Emitted by the harness daemon itself, mostly for UI-facing status and
for control of the emit/intercept pipeline.

- **`harness.notice`** — A free-form notice from the harness for the user.
  Notices include `kind` (stable machine-readable type), `message`, `level`
  (`critical`, `warning`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace`), and optional
  `always_show`. UIs filter notices locally by their configured notice-level;
  critical and `always_show` notices remain visible. Current first-party kinds
  include `extension.config_error`, `extension.optional_skipped`,
  `extension.notice` for sanitized extension-authored notices,
  `harness.failure`, `harness.internal_warning`, `harness.notice`,
  `harness.replay_error`, `model.selection`, `skill.collision`, and
  `ui.command_error`. Expected skill-name collisions are trace-level notices.
  Extension-authored skill diagnostics are sanitized to `extension.notice`; add a
  first-party kind here only when the harness owns and preserves it.
- **`harness.ui_dir`** — Announces the UI state directory for UI-facing helpers.
- **`harness.started`** — Announces the typed run id for this harness
  process. Participants can use the id to correlate per-run debug artifacts.
- **`harness.models_available`** — The full provider-published model list
  as `provider/model_id` strings. Re-emitted when provider snapshots change.
- **`harness.roles_available`** — Snapshot of roles currently available from
  effective configuration, including their display descriptions for UIs.
- **`harness.role_selected`** — Which role is currently selected, plus
  the model it resolves to and that model's context-window size if known.
- **`harness.context_usage_changed`** — Updated input/cached token counts
  and percent-of-context-window for the selected role's resolved model,
  after each agent response that reports usage.
- **`harness.agent_context_usage_changed`** — Updated context-usage snapshot for
  a specific agent, used by UIs that render per-agent context pressure.
- **`harness.efforts_available`** — Which effort levels are valid for the
  selected role's resolved model. Empty when the selected role has no
  resolved model or the provider doesn't support reasoning.
- **`harness.verbosities_available`** — Which output verbosity levels are valid
  for the selected role's resolved model. Empty means no resolved model;
  `[medium]` means the provider does not expose a verbosity knob.
- **`harness.thinking_summaries_available`** — Which thinking-summary modes are
  valid for the selected role's resolved model. Empty means no resolved model;
  `[off]` means the provider does not support thinking summaries.

## Agent transcript and prompt lifecycle

Emitted mostly by the harness as it routes UI requests into concrete global
agents. Durable transcript facts are written to the owning agent log, not the
harness runtime state. `agent.started` is the durable, immutable creation fact
at the start of an agent log.

- **`agent.load`** — Request to load an existing durable agent into this harness.
- **`agent.loading`** — Transient fact that an existing durable agent is being
  replayed before it becomes fully loaded.
- **`agent.loaded`** — Transient fact that a durable agent is available for
  prompt routing in this harness after durable transcript catch-up. Metadata is
  reconstructed from `agent.started` plus `agent.metadata_*` facts, not carried
  on this boundary.
- **`agent.unloaded`** — Transient fact that a durable agent is no longer
  available for prompt routing in this harness.
- **`agent.prompt_submitted`** — A `ui.prompt_submitted` request was accepted
  into a concrete agent transcript. Carries `agent_id`, text, originator, and
  user/internal message class.
- **`agent.prompt_queued`** — A prompt arrived while the agent was busy and was
  queued instead of dispatched. Runtime UI state; not durable transcript truth.
- **`agent.prompt_recalled`** — A queued prompt was recalled for editing.
- **`agent.prompt_steered`** — A previously queued prompt is folded into an
  in-flight turn as a steering user message rather than starting a fresh turn.
- **`agent.user_message_injected`** — A synthetic user message inserted by the
  harness (e.g. `!`-shell command output, AGENTS.md preamble). Folds into the
  agent tree like a real user prompt.
- **`agent.prompt_created`** — The harness assembled a provider prompt and
  assigned it an `agent_prompt_id`; payload carries `agent_id`,
  `system_prompt`, materialized `context`, tools or `tools_ref`, model, model
  params, tool choice, originator/provenance, legacy cache-sharing flag,
  optional UI correlation id, and optional compaction summary. First-party
  ChatGPT/Codex cache routing is stable per target agent and does not split on
  those provenance fields. This is
  operational delivery state for the provider; transcript truth is still the
  accepted prompt, provider response, terminal tool results, and compaction
  facts.
- **`agent.state`** — Transient live runtime snapshot for one agent. Carries
  `agent_id` plus `idle`/`running` state so UIs can show work in progress
  without treating it as transcript history.
- **`agent.prompt_terminated`** — A prompt ended without an accepted
  `provider.response_finished` (stale or canceled). Runtime lifecycle state.
- **`agent.prompt_prewarm_requested`** — Best-effort provider cache prewarm for
  the next prompt prefix. Runtime/provider optimization state.
- **`agent.compaction_triggered`** — Durable manual compaction trigger inserted
  into an agent transcript. Prompt assembly folds it into provider-side
  compaction input; it is not a separate compaction lifecycle event.
- **`agent.display_name_set`** — Durable fact that changes an agent's
  human-friendly display name. Carries `agent_id` and the new non-empty display
  name; UIs use it when rendering agent chips and history.
- **`agent.metadata_set`** / **`agent.metadata_unset`** — Durable,
  interceptable per-agent metadata updates. Keys are strings, values are
  arbitrary CBOR capped at 64 KiB, and `metadata_set` carries an `inheritable`
  flag copied to child agents at creation time. Extensions use these facts for
  extension-visible state such as `ext_core-shell_cwd`.
- **`agent.started`** — Durable creation fact for an agent. It carries optional
  `parent_agent` and initial metadata; inheritable metadata from that parent is
  copied into the new agent during the start sequence for consumers to fold
  before the metadata-free `agent.loaded` boundary.
- **`agent.head_moved`** — Durable fact that changes an agent's selected tree
  head after navigation, so future prompts branch from the requested node.

## Provider execution

Emitted by the provider backend that owns the selected model.

- **`provider.models_updated`** — Provider extension replacement snapshot of
  currently servable models and their capabilities. The harness folds provider
  snapshots into `harness.models_available` and related role/model availability
  events.
- **`provider.prompt_submitted`** — The provider accepted an `agent.prompt_created`
  and started processing it. Echoes the originator. Transient.
- **`provider.response_updated`** — Replace-style ordered item streaming
  snapshot. Consumers render `items` in order; each entry is either a completed
  non-durable context item or an in-progress message, reasoning text, tool-call,
  or compaction lifecycle item. Transient by default.
- **`provider.response_finished`** — Final assistant output in original
  item order via `output_items`, plus optional usage, provider
  response id, backend metadata, and echoed originator. Routed by the
  harness based on the originator.
- **`provider.tool_result`** / **`provider.tool_error`** — Provider-facing
  terminal tool-call completions. These satisfy provider protocol state and
  fold into prompt history, but are not logical UI tool completions. The
  synthetic background placeholder uses `provider.tool_result` only.
- **`provider.cache_miss_diagnostic`** — Provider-owned diagnostic for a prompt
  with unexpectedly low cache reuse. The harness accepts it only from the
  provider that owns the prompt, and providers emit it before the matching
  `provider.response_finished` closes the pending provider route.
## Tools

Tool events span three emitters: extensions register/implement tools,
the agent requests calls, and the harness orchestrates dispatch.

- **`tool.register`** *(extension)* — A tool provider advertises a tool
  spec (name, description, JSON-schema parameters, `enabled_by_default`,
  and legacy execution-mode metadata).
- **`tool.unregister`** *(extension)* — A previously registered tool is
  withdrawn.
- **`tool.request`** *(provider/extension)* — A runtime request to run a
  tool call by id, owner agent id, model-produced name, and CBOR arguments. It
  may come from an agent response or another extension, and can still be
  rejected before any tool provider receives it. Extension-authored
  `call_id`s must be non-empty and globally unique; empty ids or collisions
  with any known live, completed, or durable transcript tool call are refused
  with `harness.notice` only, not a call-id-keyed terminal event. Transcript
  tool-call truth comes from the provider response's `ContextItem::ToolCall`,
  not this routing event.
- **`tool.started`** *(harness)* — The harness accepted and routed a
  tool request. This runtime broadcast is the signal that the selected tool
  provider should start the call, and that UIs can show a generic pending tool
  line. It intentionally carries no provider-owned display formatting; the tool
  provider owns argument parsing and presentation.
- **`tool.rejected`** *(harness)* — The harness rejected a tool request
  before any tool provider was asked to run it. UIs can display this as a tool
  call rejection.
- **`tool.result`** *(extension/harness)* — Successful logical runtime tool
  completion, by call id, with tool-owned `result` plus optional UI
  `display` metadata and echoed originator. This event is renderer-facing.
  Provider-only terminal completions use `provider.tool_result` instead.
- **`tool.error`** *(extension)* — Logical tool failure with a message and
  optional structured details. Operational only; transient. Provider-only
  terminal failures use `provider.tool_error` instead.
- **`tool.background_result`** / **`tool.background_error`** *(harness)* —
  Logical notification that a backgrounded tool later completed for real.
  The earlier synthetic placeholder is provider-facing only and is not
  emitted as `tool.result`.
- **`tool.progress`** *(extension)* — In-flight progress update with an
  optional message, current/total counters, and/or complete display state.
  Providers should usually emit an initial `tool.progress` immediately after
  receiving `tool.started`, before expensive work, to replace the UI's generic
  pending line with provider-owned formatting.
- **`tool.cancel_request`** *(harness)* — The harness asks an extension to cancel an
  in-flight call.
- **`tool.cancelled`** *(extension)* — The extension acknowledges that a
  call has been cancelled. Operational only; transient.
- **`tool.delegate_progress`** *(harness)* — Live snapshot of a sub-agent
  spawned by the `agent_start` tool: task name, resolved delegate role,
  tools-in-flight, total, context tokens, percent. Transient; the UI
  re-renders the parent tool block.

## Actions

Action events carry slash-command/action schema and invocation traffic between
extensions, the harness, and interested UIs.

- **`action.schema_published`** — An extension publishes its current action
  schema tree, including command names, descriptions, arguments, and action ids.
- **`action.invoke`** — The harness or UI requests execution of a published
  action by id with CBOR/YAML-compatible arguments and correlation metadata.
- **`action.result`** — The action provider returns a successful result for a
  prior invocation.
- **`action.error`** — The action provider reports an invocation failure with a
  human-readable message and optional structured detail.

## Extensions

Two sub-classes:

### Extension supervision (harness supervisor)

Emitted by the harness's supervisor as it manages child extension
processes.

- **`extension.starting`** — A child extension process is being spawned
  (instance id, name, pid).
- **`extension.ready`** — The extension's `Ready` message was received
  by the supervisor, which synthesizes this bus event so subscribers can
  observe that the extension is fully online.
- **`extension.exited`** — The child process exited; carries exit code
  and/or signal.
- **`extension.restarting`** — The supervisor is restarting an extension
  (attempt counter, optional reason).

### Extension-emitted

Emitted by extensions to advertise capabilities or interact with the
harness/agent.

- **`extension.skill_available`** — The extension discovered a skill on
  disk: name, description, file path, whether to inject it into the
  system prompt, whether users may invoke it with `/skill`, whether model-side
  invocation is disabled (which implies user invocation), and an optional argument hint.
- **`extension.agents_md_available`** — The extension discovered an
  AGENTS.md file and is shipping its contents eagerly so the harness
  can inject them without a tool round-trip.
- **`extension.context_provider_register`** — The extension registers a named
  context provider that can publish agent context updates.
- **`extension.context_ready`** — The extension finished publishing
  refreshed prompt context for one agent.
- **`extension.agent_context_publish`** — The extension publishes context for a
  particular agent/context provider slot.
- **`extension.prompt_fragment_publish`** — The extension publishes a prompt
  fragment contribution that prompt assembly may include according to config.
- **`extension.prompt_submit_request`** — An extension request to submit a
  normal user-style prompt to an already loaded agent. The harness validates the
  target agent and, when accepted, publishes the normal durable
  `agent.prompt_submitted` fact; extensions must not forge transcript prompt
  facts directly.
- **`agent.start_request`** — An extension or harness-owned tool asks
  the harness to start a side/sub-agent conversation: instruction text,
  correlation `query_id`, optional requested `role`, optional tool-call
  attribution, and human-readable task name (used by the `agent_start` tool).
  Tool-backed delegate requests default to `senior-engineer` when `role` is
  absent; non-tool requests without `role` use the currently selected
  interactive role.
- **`agent.start_accepted`** — The harness accepted an agent-start request and
  created or reused the delegated agent route for the requested task.
- **`agent.start_result`** — The agent's final answer to an
  earlier `agent.start_request`, routed point-to-point back to the
  requesting extension. Carries the same `query_id`.
- **`agent.message_sent`** — Harness-owned immutable sender-side projection for
  a short message an agent sent to another agent or to the user. Carries stable
  `message_id`, `sender_id`, recipient (`agent_id` or `user`), and `message`; it
  is independent of the recipient's local UI state.
- **`agent.message_received`** — Harness-owned immutable recipient-side
  projection for an agent-to-agent message. Carries the same stable
  `message_id`, the `sender_id`, the receiving `recipient_id`, and `message`;
  user-recipient messages have no received projection. User-recipient sent
  projections are human-visible broadcasts that UIs always render fully in the
  currently visible transcript. UI subscribers filter, summarize, or fully
  display agent-to-agent message projections according to `/set show-messages`.
  Agent recipients are delivered as hidden internal prompts; if a side/delegate
  agent is about to finish, teardown waits until the message turn has been
  dispatched and answered. Interceptors cannot drop or rewrite these validated
  projections. See [agent-messaging.md](agent-messaging.md) for model-facing tool
  examples.
- **`extension.event`** — Custom extension-defined event with an
  extension-owned dotted name and CBOR payload. The nested name must have
  non-empty category and call segments, and must not use reserved first-party
  categories (`tool`, `action`, `agent`, `extension`, `provider`, `harness`,
  `ui`, `shell`, or `term`). The harness
  routes it like any other event. It is runtime/debug-log state unless a typed
  semantic event is added for a durable use case.

## UI

Emitted by attached UI clients (tau-cli-term, etc.) to express user
intent.

- **`ui.prompt_submitted`** — The user submitted a prompt request for an
  existing agent: text, required `agent_id`, originator (defaults to
  `user`; reused for extension-driven side prompts), and user/internal message
  class. The harness translates accepted requests into durable
  `agent.prompt_submitted` facts.
- **`ui.prompt_draft`** — Trailing-edge debounced (≤1/s) snapshot of the
  current draft buffer. Transient — used for "user is alive" signals
  (e.g. notification idle reset), not persisted.
- **`ui.focus_changed`** — Attached terminal UI reports focus gained/lost for a
  terminal when focus events are available. Transient; used for idle and
  notification behavior, not transcript truth.
- **`ui.role_select`** — User requests a role switch. The harness resolves
  the role to a provider-published model at runtime.
- **`ui.agent_model_select`** — User requests a model override for a loaded
  agent. `agent_id` may be omitted only when the harness can unambiguously infer
  the target from current/default agent state.
- **`ui.role_update`** — User changes or deletes a role. Wire actions are
  `delete`, `set_model`, `set_effort`, `set_verbosity`,
  `set_thinking_summary`, `set_service_tier`, `set_compaction_threshold`,
  `set_tools`, `set_enable_tool_groups`, `set_disable_tool_groups`,
  `set_enable_tools`, and `set_disable_tools`. Nullable override setters,
  including `set_tools`, use `null` or omission to clear back to
  model/provider fallback behavior. For `set_tools`, an empty list is an
  explicit empty tool allow-list; the enable/disable vector setters replace
  their corresponding lists, including with empty lists.
- **`ui.detach_request`** — UI is detaching but wants the daemon to keep
  running so a later `tau --attach` can reconnect.
- **`ui.shell_command`** — User submitted a `!` (in-context) or `!!`
  (UI-only) shell command. Carries command id, command, and
  `include_in_context` flag.
- **`ui.create_agent`** — UI requests creation of a durable user-owned agent,
  optionally with the first prompt to append after context loads. The request
  carries the role, initial metadata, optional parent agent, optional prompt
  correlation id, and optional `model_override`; when present, `model_override`
  is installed on the new agent before its first prompt is queued or routed.
- **`ui.tree_request`** — User typed `/tree`: render the selected or targeted
  agent branching tree to chat.
- **`ui.navigate_tree`** — User typed `/tree <id>`: move the selected or targeted
  agent head to that node so the next prompt branches off there.
- **`ui.compact_request`** — User typed `/compact`: request provider-side
  compaction for the selected or targeted agent before the next prompt.
- **`ui.cancel_prompt`** — User requests cancellation by optional target agent
  and optional prompt id; applies to active or queued
  prompt work when still present.
- **`ui.recall_queued_prompt`** — User requests removing the most recently queued
  prompt from the selected or targeted agent so it can be edited/resubmitted.
- **`ui.set_agent_display_name`** — User requests a durable display-name update
  for a known agent; accepted requests produce
  `agent.display_name_set`.

## Shell (shell extension, user-initiated commands)

Emitted by `tau-ext-shell` (or any extension implementing `!`/`!!`
commands) in response to a `ui.shell_command`.

- **`shell.command_progress`** — A chunk of stdout/stderr from a running
  user-initiated shell command, correlated by `command_id`. Transient.
- **`shell.command_finished`** — A user-initiated shell command exited
  or was cancelled. Echoes command, optional target agent id, and
  `include_in_context` flag from the originating request, plus the
  truncated combined output, exit code, and `cancelled` flag. When
  `include_in_context` is set, the harness injects the output only into the
  validated target agent. An unknown or non-live target is ignored; targetless
  output goes to the unambiguous current
  user agent, creating one if needed, and ambiguous targetless candidates are
  refused.

## Term (terminal-output side effects)

Targeted at whichever UI is attached and capable of writing escape
sequences to a real terminal. Harness-owned code and extensions may emit these;
the UI is the only consumer. Components without a terminal silently no-op.

- **`term.osc1337_set_user_var`** — Ask the UI to write an iTerm2
  OSC 1337 `SetUserVar` escape sequence. The UI base64-encodes the
  value and tmux-wraps if needed. Useful for surfacing notifications,
  build status, or other state to terminal-side tooling.
- **`term.bell`** — Ask the attached terminal UI to ring/flash according to the
  user's terminal settings. It may become a sound, visual flash, desktop
  notification, or no-op.
