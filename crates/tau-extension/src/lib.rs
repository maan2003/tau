//! Optional building blocks for tau extension processes.
//!
//! Three independent utilities, each opt-in:
//!
//! - [`Handshake`] writes the standard Hello/Subscribe/Intercept/startup-event/
//!   Ready prelude every extension opens its session with.
//! - [`init_logging_for`] (or [`init_logging`] when there is no single target
//!   to scope to) installs a stderr `tracing_subscriber` filtered by the
//!   `TAU_LOG` env var.
//! - [`parse_config`] decodes the harness-supplied `LifecycleConfigure.config`
//!   into a typed struct, flattening `ciborium::value::Error`'s debug shape
//!   into a one-line message.
//!
//! Nothing here is required — an extension may use one helper, all
//! three, or none. The crate exists only to hold pieces that more
//! than one extension would otherwise copy-paste.
//!
//! ## Per-extension log targets
//!
//! Each extension is expected to declare a short target string and
//! pass it as `target:` to the `tracing` macros. The convention is:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! pub const LOG_TARGET: &str = "std-notifications";
//!
//! tracing::info!(target: LOG_TARGET, "idle deadline armed");
//! ```
//!
//! Then `TAU_LOG=std-notifications=trace,info` filters that
//! extension at trace level while leaving everything else at info.
//! Targets are arbitrary `&'static str` — any name an extension
//! likes — so use one short, distinctive identifier per extension
//! and document it next to the const.
//!
//! ## Why a separate env var
//!
//! `RUST_LOG` is reserved for the wider host environment (the
//! harness, embedded crates, third-party libraries). Extensions
//! deserve their own knob so users can crank one extension to trace
//! without flooding stderr with everything else.
//!
//! ## Recommended shape for [`parse_config`] config structs
//!
//! Declare the extension's config struct with
//! `#[serde(default, deny_unknown_fields)]` so missing fields fall
//! back to `Default` while unknown fields surface as actionable
//! errors instead of being silently dropped:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[derive(serde::Deserialize, Default)]
//! #[serde(default, deny_unknown_fields)]
//! struct MyConfig { /* fields */ }
//! ```
