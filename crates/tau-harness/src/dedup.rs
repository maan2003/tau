//! Per-conversation deduplication of large, byte-identical tool
//! results.
//!
//! Models occasionally re-issue identical reads, repeat the same
//! probing shell command (`jj status`, `cargo check` after a no-op
//! edit), or emit the same parallel tool call twice in one batch.
//! Each repetition pins a copy of the tool output into the prompt
//! prefix forever, both bloating the steady-state context and
//! defeating the prompt cache for every subsequent turn that has to
//! re-anchor on the larger prefix.
//!
//! This module replaces the *content* of any tool result whose CBOR
//! encoding hashes to the same value as a result already on the
//! conversation's branch with a short pointer
//! (`[tau-dedup] same as <tool_name> <call_id>`). The first
//! occurrence is kept verbatim — only the duplicates are collapsed.
//! The model can cross-reference the pointer to the original
//! `call_id` which is still present earlier in its own context.
//!
//! Three invariants protect correctness:
//!
//! 1. **Branch isolation.** The map is per-conversation and rebuilt from the
//!    conversation's branch when the cursor moves non-linearly (e.g.
//!    `UiNavigateTree` to a sibling tip). A pointer can never reference a
//!    `call_id` the model can't see in its own assembled history.
//!
//! 2. **First-write-only.** Replacement happens at result-intake time, before
//!    the result is folded into the session tree. Once recorded the entry is
//!    frozen for the rest of the session, preserving the harness's
//!    linear-prefix invariant for the upstream prompt cache.
//!
//! 3. **Threshold gated.** Results whose serialized form is below
//!    [`DEFAULT_THRESHOLD_BYTES`] are not deduped at all — the pointer text
//!    itself runs ~50 B, so single-digit savings aren't worth the extra hop the
//!    model has to make to recover the original.
