//! Build metadata exposed to spawned processes (e.g. the shell
//! extension's child commands).
//!
//! Git revision and build date are stored as fixed-size byte arrays in
//! a dedicated link section. The Nix packaging step rewrites those
//! bytes in-place with `bbe` after the binary is built, which lets the
//! cargo build cache stay reproducible across commits.
//!
//! Why a `static [u8; N]` (and not the `built` crate's `&str`
//! constants): release builds with LTO inline short string literals as
//! `mov imm32` operands in `.text`, splitting the bytes across two
//! instructions in reverse order. The placeholder then no longer
//! exists as a contiguous byte sequence anywhere in the file, and bbe
//! has nothing to patch. A `#[used]` byte array in a named section is
//! guaranteed to live in `.rodata` as one contiguous, unmerged blob.
