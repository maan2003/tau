        // Reasons this is a design choice, not dead weight:
        //
        // 1. **Pre-warm AGENTS.md and skill discovery.** The default session is the
        //    fallback when a caller (embedded or socket) doesn't specify one, and even
        //    when callers pick their own `chat-<ts>` id they still benefit: ext-shell
        //    has already walked `~/.agents/` + the cwd ancestor chain once, so the
        //    second init is cache-warm.
        //
        // 2. **Surface discovery before the first prompt.** The CLI prints "loaded: …"
        //    as events arrive; doing this at startup gives the user visible
        //    confirmation that their AGENTS.md was found — before they type anything —
        //    instead of bundling that feedback into the first agent response.
        //
        // 3. **Fail loudly at startup, not mid-first-turn.** If a provider hangs or the
        //    discovery logic panics, the process hits `StartupTimeout` here rather than
        //    appearing to accept the first prompt and then silently stalling.
        //
        // Every past agent that touched this code has "noticed" that
        // the CLI uses `chat-<ts>` session ids and concluded the eager
        // init is wasted work. It isn't. Please resist the urge.
