        //
        // 1. **Pre-warm AGENTS.md and skill discovery.** The default session is the
        //    fallback when a caller (embedded or socket) doesn't specify one, and even
        //    when callers pick their own `chat-<ts>` id they still benefit: ext-shell
        //    has already walked `~/.agents/` + the cwd ancestor chain once, so the
        //    second init is cache-warm.
        //
        // 2. **Surface discovery before the first prompt.** The CLI prints "loaded: …"
        //    as events arrive; doing this at startup gives the user visible
        //    confirmation that their AGENTS.md was found — before they type anything —
        //    instead of bundling that feedback into the first agent response.
        //
        // 3. **Fail loudly at startup, not mid-first-turn.** If a provider hangs or the
        //    discovery logic panics, the process hits `StartupTimeout` here rather than
        //    appearing to accept the first prompt and then silently stalling.
        //
        // Every past agent that touched this code has "noticed" that
        // the CLI uses `chat-<ts>` session ids and concluded the eager
        // init is wasted work. It isn't. Please resist the urge.

                     workflows they care about, so reach for this tool early: \
                     before tackling any request that touches a tool, command, \
                     framework, or domain you are not deeply familiar with — or \
                     anything the user might have an opinionated way of doing — \
                     run `search` first. A 1-second search beats a guess that \
                     the user has to correct. Two actions:\n\
                     - `search`: find skills whose name or description match \
                     one or more keywords. `query` accepts a single string or \
                     an array of strings; with an array, each term is searched \
                     independently and results are merged and ranked by how \
                     many terms hit. When a task could plausibly map to \
                     several names (\"commit\", \"git commit\", \"version \
                     control\"), pass them all as an array — the top-ranked \
                     hit is usually the right skill. Returns a list of \
                     {name, description, hit_count}. Set \
                     `search_content: true` to also grep skill bodies. Most \
                     skills are NOT pre-advertised in <available_skills>, so \
                     a missing entry there is no reason to skip the search.\n\
                     - `load`: fetch a skill's full content by exact name. \
                     Use this once `search` (or <available_skills>) gives you \
                     a name."
