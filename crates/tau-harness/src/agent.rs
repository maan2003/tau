//! Per-agent runtime state tracked by the harness.
//!
//! An [`Agent`] is one live prompt/tool execution context loaded into the
//! current harness. The durable transcript lives in `tau-core`'s
//! `AgentTree`; this module stores the harness-owned runtime state layered on
//! top of that transcript: the selected branch head, queued prompts, turn
//! lifecycle, tool progress, and side-agent ancestry used for routing.
//!
//! The harness multiplexes incoming agent and tool events back to the owning
//! agent via two id maps it owns:
//! `prompt_agents: HashMap<AgentPromptId, AgentId>` and
//! `tool_agents: HashMap<ToolCallId, AgentId>`.
