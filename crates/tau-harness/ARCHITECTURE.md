# tau-harness architecture

`tau-harness` owns the daemon-side control plane for Tau agents. It connects
clients and extensions, sequences events, applies interception, persists durable
agent facts, and delivers committed events to subscribers.

## Event sequencing, interception, and persistence

All ordinary event publication should flow through the central publish path:
`enqueue_publish` runs interceptors in priority order, `commit_event` stamps a
single runtime sequence/timestamp, writes debug/event-log records, persists
eligible semantic facts, and broadcasts delivery frames. Direct calls to
`commit_event` are reserved for code that has already resolved interception.

Interceptors are local privileged extensions. They can inspect, modify, or drop
most matching events before commit. The harness protects selected facts as
must-pass and immutable because live state, durable resume state, and transcript
routing must agree. Fully immutable facts include harness-owned lifecycle
facts, loaded-agent facts, `agent.started`, harness-owned agent message
projections, terminal tool completion facts (`tool.result`, `tool.error`,
`provider.tool_result`, `provider.tool_error`, `tool.cancelled`,
`tool.background_result`, and `tool.background_error`), and selected response
closure facts such as `provider.response_finished`. Prompt text facts are
must-pass, but only their routing keys are immutable: interceptors may rewrite
text on the sanctioned prompt-text events without changing agent id, message
class, or originator. Mandatory `harness.notice` diagnostics (critical notices
and `always_show` warnings such as extension config errors) are replayable,
published with a call-site `must_pass` override, and protected from interceptor
rewrite/drop.

## Loaded agents and agent stores

Loaded-agent membership is runtime state owned by the harness process.
`agent.loading`, `agent.loaded`, and `agent.unloaded` are transient, must-pass
snapshots of that runtime state; they are not durable transcript facts. For
explicit durable loads, `agent.loading` announces that replay catch-up is about
to begin, replayed durable facts follow, and metadata-free `agent.loaded` marks
the catch-up-complete boundary where the agent is fully loaded for subscribers.
Agent stores own durable transcript facts, including `agent.started`, prompt
facts, provider/tool results, harness-owned inter-agent message projections, and
per-agent metadata set/unset facts. Metadata is committed through the same
interceptable publish path as other ordinary events. When an explicit or derived
parent is known, inheritable parent entries are folded into the child
`agent.started` creation metadata as defaults, and explicit child initial
metadata wins on key collisions. Tests should assert durable stores, not only
runtime delivery, when changing durable facts.

## Extension boundary

Extensions are less-trusted peers connected over the Tau protocol. They may
publish ordinary events through `emit`, subscribe to committed events, register
interceptors, provide tools/actions/context, and request extension-data file
operations. The harness validates source ownership for harness-owned or
provider-owned facts and rejects peer-authored lifecycle, membership,
transcript, prompt, and harness-status facts unless they arrive through the
specific API path that owns them. Interceptor replacement is intentionally
conservative: protected facts may be observed, but drops and forbidden rewrites
publish the original event so routing identities and durable folds stay aligned.
Mutable prompt-text events may be rewritten only without changing their routing
identity.

The harness updates loaded-agent routing state before the corresponding
must-pass lifecycle publish commits. That keeps idempotency stable while an
interceptor parks publication and prevents duplicate load/start facts from being
queued for the same live agent. For explicit `agent.load`, the harness records a
post-commit continuation so durable transcript history is replayed only after
the matching `agent.loading` boundary has committed, and final `agent.loaded` is
published after that catch-up replay.

Provider tool calls are evaluated against the tool snapshot owned by the prompt
that produced them. Model-visible rejection diagnostics for those calls must use
that same snapshot for availability wording and near-name suggestions; current
role/model policy is only the authority when no prompt-owned snapshot exists.
Tool examples are registration metadata, not prompt-surface definitions: rendered
tool definitions omit them, and the harness surfaces at most one bounded relevant
example after a failed call in an agent branch.

Extensions that need to turn external user input into a normal agent prompt use
`extension.prompt_submit_request`. The harness accepts this request only on the
extension path, validates the target loaded agent, and then submits a normal
user prompt through the same machinery as UI prompt intake. The durable
transcript fact remains the harness-owned `agent.prompt_submitted`; extensions
may not forge prompt or message transcript facts directly.

## Optional extension startup

Extension startup availability is controlled by resolved `ExtensionConfig.require`.
Required extensions preserve startup-fatal behavior for harness-owned init
failures such as missing commands, missing required declared secrets, spawn
failure, and pre-Ready timeout. Other pre-Ready disconnect handling follows the
existing compatibility behavior unless the disconnect is already provider/socket
fatal. Optional extensions (`require: false`) are skipped or disabled for
startup/config/secret/pre-Ready failures, but the failure must still be emitted as
a mandatory replayable `harness.notice` so initial and late UI subscribers see why
the extension is absent. This policy is limited to startup/init availability; do
not broaden it into new post-Ready respawn or runtime-failure semantics without a
separate design change.

## Extension data

Extension-data RPCs confine paths to per-extension state roots, reject traversal
and symlink escapes, write private files/directories where supported, and enforce
per-file/per-directory-list quotas. Quota failures are reported as
`quota_exceeded`. These limits bound individual harness operations, not aggregate
extension disk usage across many files.

## Skills

The harness owns canonical discovered-skill state. Extensions such as `tau-ext-shell` announce candidate skill files, but the harness validates names/descriptions, resolves collisions by selected winner, stores user/model invocation flags, and builds model-visible prompt/tool snapshots from the current winners. `disable-model-invocation` removes a winner from `<available_skills>` and from the internal `skill` tool snapshot, and makes it user-invocable; it is a prompt-surface policy, not a filesystem security boundary.

User `/skill <name> [args]` and `/skill:<name> [args]` expansion is performed at harness prompt intake for both existing-agent prompts and new-agent initial prompts. Unknown, invalid, unreadable, or non-user-invocable commands emit `harness.notice` and are not submitted as model prompts. Successful invocations read a bounded skill-file prefix, strip frontmatter, and store the expanded Pi-style `<skill>` block in the normal prompt transcript.

## Tool prompt-surface policy

Extensions and providers publish metadata only: tools declare neutral `ToolTag`s
(such as `shell:edit:line`, `shell:edit:apply_patch`, `shell:exec:generic`,
`shell:exec:shell_command`, and `shell:cd`) and providers publish model
`ModelTag`s (such as `shell:chatgpt`). The harness owns all matching policy.

Tool enablement starts from each extension's `enabled_by_default`, then matching
harness `tool_policy.rules` run deterministically by `(priority, rule name)`,
with each rule applying `disable_tool_tags` before `enable_tool_tags`. Built-in
and user policy share the same evaluator; the built-in `builtin.chatgpt-shell`
rule disables `shell:*` for ChatGPT-tagged models and re-enables apply-patch,
shell-command, cd, and directory-lock tools.

Role precedence is broad-to-specific and runs after global policy: optional
`tools` allow-list base, `disable_tool_tags`, `enable_tool_tags`,
`disable_tool_groups`, `enable_tool_groups`, `disable_tools`, then
`enable_tools`. This deliberately lets a role disable a broad family and
re-enable a narrower tag, group, or named tool.

Prompt dispatch snapshots the effective `ToolSpec` list for the selected prompt
model. Provider tool calls are validated against that prompt-owned snapshot, not
against mutable current role/model state after the user switches roles or models
mid-turn. Staged tool registration can never expand a prompt snapshot after it
was sent.

Narrow schema-guided argument repair also uses the prompt-owned `ToolSpec`.
Repair runs only after pre-dispatch validation failure, applies a small fixed set
of mechanical conversions, revalidates before dispatch, and falls back to the
normal rejection diagnostics when repair is unsupported or still invalid. Repair
traces are bounded metadata for logs/UI, not prompt-surface examples.

The loop guard is runtime-only per loaded agent branch. It records compact recent
assistant/tool-failure signatures, injects one hidden pivot prompt for obvious
cycles, and surfaces a mandatory notice instead of continuing automatically if the
same cycle persists. New user prompts and successful tool results reset detector
history and remove pending loop-guard pivots, but preserve unresolved in-flight
tool-call argument signatures for sibling calls in the same turn. Branch/head
moves invalidate the whole guard, including in-flight signatures, and remove
pending loop-guard pivots.

## Lifecycle events

Harness lifecycle events such as agent loading/shutdown and extension status are
normal events unless specifically marked must-pass/immutable. Agent lifecycle
facts are protected because extensions and context providers use them to set up
or tear down per-agent state. Extension lifecycle/status events are runtime
observability facts and may be intercepted like other non-protected events unless
call-site policy says otherwise.

## Provider response update routing

The harness treats `provider.response_updated` as non-durable live progress. It validates that the publishing connection owns the in-flight provider prompt, overwrites the update `agent_id` from harness prompt ownership, enriches best-effort compaction metadata, and does not include these transient deltas in durable replay.
