# tau-ext-shell architecture

`tau-ext-shell` owns Tau's local filesystem and subprocess tools. It must avoid
process-global cwd changes after startup: concurrent tool workers resolve paths
against per-agent state instead.

## Per-agent cwd metadata

The extension instance name from `configure.instance_name` defines the cwd
metadata key: `ext_<instance>_cwd`. The built-in core shell instance therefore
uses `ext_core-shell_cwd`. If multiple shell instances are configured, each uses
its own instance-derived key and keeps an independent cwd map.

`agent.started` creation metadata and committed `agent.metadata_set` /
`agent.metadata_unset` events are the source of truth for cwd. Metadata-free
`agent.loaded` is the catch-up-complete boundary for initial per-agent context
publication. The extension updates its in-memory `CwdState` only after seeing
those committed facts, publishes fresh `agent_context.cwd` after each live
change, and emits `extension.context_ready` only after publishing the initial
cwd context for a loaded agent. Metadata values are inheritable so child agents
start in the parent's remembered cwd.

## Cwd-aware tools and locks

The `cd` tool changes the remembered cwd by emitting `agent.metadata_set` and a
model-visible `agent.user_message_injected` notice. Explicit `cwd` arguments on
shell tools also emit metadata and update remembered cwd. Relative paths for
filesystem tools (`read`, `edit`, `find`, `grep`, `ls`, `apply_patch`, and
`dir_lock`) are resolved against the remembered cwd before execution or automatic
lock selection. Once automatic lock selection begins, the invocation carries the
same cwd snapshot through lock waiting and execution, even if committed cwd
metadata changes before the lock is granted. This keeps locks, shell execution,
and patch paths aligned without calling `chdir(2)` in the extension process.

Directory locking is opt-in. When disabled, `shell` / `gpt_shell` calls are
ordinary read-write commands and no access-mode chip is published for UI display.
When enabled, shell access mode is inferred from manual lock ownership: a command
whose cwd is covered by the caller's manual lock is read-write and takes an
automatic lock; otherwise it is read-only.

The read-write inference and automatic lock acquisition happen under the
`DirLockManager` state lock. A shell call queued as read-write must still have
covering manual-lock ownership at the moment the automatic lock is granted;
otherwise it falls back to read-only execution instead of running under stale
coverage.

## Tool tags

`tau-ext-shell` tags tools with neutral capability metadata such as
`shell:edit:line`, `shell:edit:apply_patch`, `shell:exec:generic`,
`shell:exec:shell_command`, and `shell:cd`. The extension must not decide which
model gets which
surface; the harness interprets these tags together with provider-published
model tags and role configuration.

## Skill and instruction discovery

`tau-ext-shell` discovers local AGENTS.md files and Markdown skills from the
working-directory and user roots, parses skill frontmatter through `tau-skills`,
canonicalizes file paths, and announces candidates to the harness. User
AGENTS.md roots are scanned before project roots in this order:
`$HOME/.config/agents`, `$HOME/.config/agents.local`, legacy `$HOME/.agents`,
and legacy `$HOME/.agents.local`. All readable, non-empty files from those roots
are stacked; the XDG roots do not suppress legacy roots.

Project skill roots stay first and are discovered from ancestor
`.agents/skills` and `.agents.local/skills` directories. User skill roots follow
as `$HOME/.config/agents/skills`, `$HOME/.config/agents.local/skills`, legacy
`$HOME/.agents/skills`, and legacy `$HOME/.agents.local/skills`. The shell
extension marks XDG user skill roots with higher source precedence than legacy
user skill roots so duplicate user skill names prefer XDG before modified time.
`tau-skills` deduplicates files found by this extension before announcement; the
harness still owns skill-name validation at the protocol boundary, canonical
winner selection among announced candidates from all sources, model/user
invocation filtering, and `/skill` prompt expansion policy.
