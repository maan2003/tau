/// Sanitize a `Command` so the child is fully detached from the
/// harness's controlling terminal:
///
/// - Overrides display-related environment variables with `TERM=dumb` /
///   `NO_COLOR=1` / `CLICOLOR=0` so well-behaved tools suppress ANSI escapes
///   and TTY-only fancy output.
/// - Clears Cargo build-time variables that can confuse tools executed outside
///   the extension's build context.
/// - Closes stdin so interactive prompts (`sudo`, `ssh`, `read`) fail fast
///   instead of hanging on input that will never arrive.
/// - On Unix, runs `setsid()` in the child so it becomes the leader of a new
///   session with no controlling terminal — even an explicit `open("/dev/tty")`
///   will fail rather than reach the harness's tty.
