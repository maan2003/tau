# tau-ext-std-notifications

A tau extension that bridges agent activity into iTerm2-style
[OSC 1337 `SetUserVar`][osc1337] user-variable updates. Mirrors the
shape of dpc's Pi extensions
[`notification-sounds.ts`][pi-sounds] and
[`idle-notification.ts`][pi-idle], adapted to tau's harness-mediated
event bus.

The extension itself does not play sounds or pop desktop notifications. It
emits configured terminal-facing side effects — OSC 1337 user-vars, terminal
bells, and detached commands. Downstream tooling is what turns those side
effects into audible or visual notifications.

## What it does

Tau's built-in configuration enables no notifications by default. When
configured, the four hook groups map to these trigger points:

| Hook | Trigger | Typical OSC user-var | Typical value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent_start` | `agent.prompt_submitted` (originator: User) | `user-notification` | `protoss-probe-ack` |
| `agent_end` | Final `provider.response_finished` (no pending tool calls, originator: User) | `user-notification` | `protoss-upgrade-complete` |
| `agent_idle` | Idle window elapses after a final response | `user-text-notification` | JSON payload (see below) |
| `agent_idle_all` | Idle window elapses after every loaded agent is idle | `user-text-notification` | JSON payload (see below) |

The "final response" filter only treats responses with `tool_calls`
empty as the end of an agent turn. Mid-turn finishes (tool-call
batches the harness will run, then re-prompt) are skipped so the
end-of-turn sound only fires once per real turn.

The `originator: User` filter ensures *side conversations* spawned
by other extensions (or by this one — see below) do not retrigger
the sounds or perturb the idle state machine.

## Idle text notification

After `delay_seconds` (default 60 when omitted on a configured idle hook) of
inactivity following a final agent response, the example `agent_idle` hook fires
the `user-text-notification` user-var with the static "Waiting for user
input" body. `agent_idle_all` uses the same hook item schema, but arms only
when the harness transitions from at least one busy loaded agent to every
loaded agent being idle.

If an idle hook sets `agent_summary` to `true`, the extension first asks the
agent for a one-sentence summary before firing that hook:

1. The extension sends an `agent.start_request` to the harness asking for a
   one-sentence summary of the conversation.
2. The harness spawns a side conversation off the user's current branch,
   dispatches the prompt to the agent, and routes the matching
   `agent.start_result` back point-to-point.
3. The extension exposes the result as `turn.agent_summary` while rendering the
   configured hook templates. On timeout or error, `turn.agent_summary` is an
   empty string. The configured template decides how, or whether, to include it.

The idle deadline resets on:

- `agent.prompt_submitted` (originator: User) — the user prompt was
  accepted into the agent transcript;
- `provider.prompt_submitted` (originator: User) — the provider is
  starting a real turn;
- `ui.prompt_draft` — trailing-edge debounced typing pings from
  the UI; the deadline jumps back by that idle hook's `delay_seconds`
  so the notification doesn't fire mid-sentence while the user is
  composing. Only applies in the `WaitingIdle` state; an
  in-flight side-query summary (`WaitingSummary`, only possible when
  `agent_summary` is enabled) is left alone because we don't
  currently have a way to cancel the agent's in-flight prompt without
  billing for it.

## Text notification payloads

The extension does not impose a text-notification schema. If you want to drive
`user-text-notification.sh` or another downstream consumer, configure the
`osc1337.key` and `osc1337.value` templates to whatever payload that consumer
expects.

## Configuration

The extension reads its config from the `extensions.<name>.config`
field of `harness.yaml`. Hook/configuration keys are snake_case; do not add
kebab-case aliases for new keys. All fields are optional; unknown fields
are rejected with a `lifecycle.config_error` so the harness can
surface typos to the user.

```json5
{
  extensions: {
    "std-notifications": {
      enable: true,
      config: {
        "agent_start": [
          { osc1337: { key: "user-notification", value: "protoss-probe-ack" } },
        ],
        "agent_end": [
          { osc1337: { key: "user-notification", value: "protoss-upgrade-complete" } },
        ],
        "agent_idle": [
          {
            delay_seconds: 60,
            agent_summary: false,
            osc1337: {
              key: "user-text-notification",
              value: "{\"title\":\"Agent idle: {{host}}:{{cwd_basename}}\",\"body\":\"Waiting for user input\"}",
            },
          },
        ],
        "agent_idle_all": [],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Each hook is an array, so a single trigger can emit multiple side
effects. Each item must set at least one action and supports:

- `bell: true` to emit `term.bell`;
- `command: ["program", "arg template", ...]` to spawn a detached command;
- `osc1337: { key, value }` to emit `term.osc1337_set_user_var`.

The `command`, `key`, and `value` strings are Handlebars templates in
strict mode. Current variables include `hook`, `agent.id`, `agent.name`
(the durable display name, falling back to the id), `host`, `cwd`,
`cwd_basename`, `turn.user_prompt`, `turn.agent_response`, and
`turn.agent_summary` (set only for idle hooks with
`agent_summary: true`, empty on timeout/error).

### Bell-only completion example

```json5
{
  extensions: {
    "std-notifications": {
      config: {
        "agent_start": [],
        "agent_end": [{ bell: true }],
        "agent_idle": [],
        "agent_idle_all": [],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Tracing

The extension uses the `std-notifications` tracing target:

```sh
TAU_LOG=std-notifications=debug tau …
```

`debug` shows `received StartAgentResult { idle_hooks, query_id,
text_len, error }` and idle-deadline transitions; `trace` adds one
line per ignored event for protocol-level debugging.
