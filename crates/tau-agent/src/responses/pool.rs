//! WebSocket connection pool for the Codex Responses backend.
//!
//! See `TODO-codex-websocket.md` §2 for the design rationale. Recap:
//!
//! - The agent's `run()` loop is single-threaded and processes prompts
//!   serially, but it *alternates* between conversations (different sessions,
//!   sub-agent delegations interleaved with the parent). The OpenAI WS endpoint
//!   only caches the *most recent* `previous_response_id` per socket, so
//!   routing A → B → A on one shared socket would flush each chain's warmth on
//!   every switch. Keep one connection per `(account, session)` so warmth
//!   survives context-switches.
//! - Single owner = the agent loop. No `Mutex`/`Arc`/`DashMap`. Take the
//!   connection *out* of the map for the duration of one turn
//!   (`HashMap::remove`), put it back on success. Connection-in-flight
//!   exclusivity is enforced by ownership.
//! - Bounded by a soft cap (env-tunable `TAU_WS_POOL_MAX`,
//!   [`DEFAULT_POOL_MAX`]). LRU eviction when full.
//! - Connections age out near the server's 60-minute hard cap so a call doesn't
//!   fail mid-turn from the server slamming the door.
//! - Bearer-mismatch on checkout means OAuth refreshed; drop the stale socket
//!   and open a new one.

#![allow(dead_code)] // wired up by the agent's `run()` loop in a later step
