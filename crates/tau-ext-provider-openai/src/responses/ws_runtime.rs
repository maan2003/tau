//! Shared Tokio runtime for provider-openai network IO.
//!
//! One process-wide multi-thread runtime, lazily started on first
//! use. The runtime is intentionally narrow in scope today (WS pool
//! tasks for the Codex Responses backend) but built broad: any
//! future async client (a tokio-based replacement for the `ureq`
//! HTTP+SSE path, for instance) can `handle().spawn(...)` here
//! without bringing its own runtime.
//!
//! Why a dedicated runtime and not async-everything at the provider
//! boundary: the provider's main loop is sync (blocking mpsc, blocking
//! frame IO via `tau_extension`). Driving async tasks from sync code
//! is fine via the `Handle::block_on` / `Sender::send` /
//! `Receiver::blocking_recv` boundary primitives.
