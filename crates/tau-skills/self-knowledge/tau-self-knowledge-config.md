# Tau configuration

Tau follows the XDG directory layout on Linux:

- Config: `~/.config/tau/`
  - `cli.yaml`, `cli.d/*.yaml` — CLI display preferences, key bindings, and prompt completions. See `tau-self-knowledge-cli-ui` for UI-specific behavior.
  - `harness.yaml`, `harness.d/*.yaml` — harness roles/defaults, extensions, tools, custom prompts, and agent/debug retention.
  - `testing.yaml` — explicit provider-profile allowlist for `tau dev tmux` E2E testing; see `tau-self-knowledge-e2e-testing`.
- State: `~/.local/state/tau/` or the platform/user state directory.
  - `agents/<agent_id>/` — durable agent transcripts and metadata.
  - `debug/<run_id>/` — per-run debug events, extension logs, and provider request captures.
  - `cli.json` — persisted CLI runtime toggles.
  - `policy.cbor` — persisted socket-client policy decisions.
  - `auth.d/<provider>.json` — provider credentials; `auth.json` may exist as legacy credentials.
- Runtime: `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/tau/harnesses/` or `/tmp/tau-$USER/harnesses/`.
  - `harnesses/<pid>.sock`, `harnesses/<pid>.json` — daemon sockets and discovery metadata.

Use `tau init` to create starter `cli.yaml` and `harness.yaml` files.

## Built-in defaults

Tau layers these defaults underneath user config and `*.d/*.yaml` drop-ins.

### Harness defaults

```yaml
{harness_config}
```

`tool_policy.rules` is harness-owned declarative tool-surface policy. Rules are
keyed so a user can disable built-ins such as `builtin.chatgpt-shell` with
`enable: false`; matching rules run `disable_tool_tags` before
`enable_tool_tags`. Rules sort by `priority` (default `0`, lower first) and then
rule name. Tag patterns are exact or terminal-prefix forms like `shell:*`. Rule
names may contain dots, so CLI overrides should use a whole-map value, for
example `tool_policy={{{{rules: {{{{builtin.chatgpt-shell: {{{{enable: false}}}}}}}}}}}}`.

### CLI UI defaults

```yaml
{ui_config}
```

## Extension availability

Harness extensions are configured under `extensions.<name>` in `harness.yaml`.
Use `enable: false` to disable an extension entirely. Enabled extensions default
to `require: true`, which preserves startup-fatal behavior for harness-owned
startup failures such as an empty command, missing required declared secret, or
spawn failure. Set `require: false` next to `enable` when the extension is useful
but optional; Tau will skip it on startup/config/secret/pre-ready failures,
continue without it, and emit a mandatory warning `harness.notice` explaining
the skip. Harness notices have stable `kind` strings and levels `critical`,
`warning`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`; CLI users can set the default threshold
with `cli.yaml` `notice_level: warning` or runtime `/set notice-level warning`.

Per-secret `optional: true` is narrower: it omits only that secret when absent.
A missing non-optional secret skips the whole extension only when
`extensions.<name>.require: false`; otherwise it remains fatal.

## Agent IDs and display names

Tau mints durable agent IDs from the harness setting `agents.id_template`. Tau can also name newly created agents with optional `agents.display_name_template`:

```yaml
agents:
  id_template: "{{{{role_group}}}}-{{{{random_alphanumeric 4}}}}"
  display_name_template: "{{{{role_group}}}}: {{{{task_name}}}}"
```

The built-in ID template is `{{{{random_alphanumeric 6}}}}`; the built-in display-name template is `{{{{#if task_name_present}}}}{{{{role}}}}: {{{{task_name}}}}{{{{else}}}}{{{{role}}}}{{{{/if}}}}`. Both template types are rendered with Handlebars in strict mode.

ID templates receive:

- `role` — the role name for the new agent.
- `role_group` — the name of the first configured role group containing the role, or the role name for ungrouped roles. `roleGroup` is also available as a camelCase alias.
- `random_alphanumeric <len>` — helper that emits an ASCII alphanumeric random suffix of at least `<len>` characters.

Display-name templates additionally receive:

- `agent_id` — the durable agent ID. `agentId` is also available as a camelCase alias.
- `task_name` — the requested task/display name for delegated or extension-started agents, or `""` when absent. `taskName` is also available as a camelCase alias.
- `task_name_present` — true when `task_name` is available. `taskNamePresent` is also available as a camelCase alias.
Rendered IDs must use only ASCII letters, digits, `_`, or `-`, and must fit Tau's agent ID length limit. If a configured ID template fails to render, renders an invalid ID, or keeps colliding, Tau warns and falls back to the built-in random template. If a configured display-name template fails to render or renders empty, Tau warns when appropriate and falls back to the request display name when one exists.

## Providers

Use `tau provider add` for the interactive provider setup wizard. It prompts for provider kind, provider namespace, auth, and model details as needed.

Other provider commands:

- `tau provider list` — show configured provider profiles.
- `tau provider remove <name>` — remove a provider profile.

Models are published by provider extensions at runtime; start Tau and use `/model` to inspect the current model list.

- `harness.yaml` can define `custom_prompts` as a map from prompt id to prompt text; in the CLI, `/prompt <id>` replaces the editable prompt buffer with that text without submitting it.
