# Tau std-rhai extension self-knowledge

`std-rhai` is Tau's disabled-by-default trusted local scripting extension. It runs `tau-ext-rhai` and lets a user-provided Rhai script observe Tau events, optionally intercept matching events, and emit Tau events through a small host API. The Rust extension owns Tau protocol framing; scripts see JSON-shaped event maps matching Serde's event form.


## Configuration

Enable it under `extensions.std-rhai` and provide a script path:

```yaml
extensions:
  std-rhai:
    enable: true
    config:
      script: "/home/me/.config/tau/hooks/demo.rhai"
      vars:
        greeting: "hello"
      limits:
        max_operations: 1000000
```

`script` is required. Absolute paths are preferred; relative paths are resolved from the extension process current working directory. `vars` is arbitrary JSON-compatible data passed into `init(config)` and `start(config)`. The harness-provided `state_dir`, when present, is also passed to both callbacks.

If config parsing, script reading, compilation, or `init` fails, the extension sends `ConfigError`, then `Ready` with a `rhai disabled: ...` message, and stays alive inert instead of exiting in a restart loop.


## Script callbacks

Scripts use JSON-shaped event maps such as:

```rhai
#{ event: "harness.notice", payload: #{ kind: "extension.notice", message: "hi", level: "info" } }
```

Supported callbacks:

```rhai
fn init(config) {
    return #{
        subscribe: [#{ kind: "exact", value: "agent.prompt_submitted" }],
        intercept: [#{
            selectors: [#{ kind: "prefix", value: "agent." }],
            priority: 0,
        }],
        ready_message: "rhai ready",
    };
}

fn start(config) {
    tau_info(`rhai started with greeting: ${config.vars.greeting}`);
}

fn on_event(event, meta) {
    if event.event == "agent.prompt_submitted" {
        tau_info(`saw prompt: ${event.payload.text}`);
    }
}

fn on_intercept(event) {
    event.payload.text = event.payload.text.replace("tao", "tau");
    return #{ kind: "pass", event: event };
}
```

`init(config)` is optional. Missing `init` or unit/no-op return means no subscriptions, no intercepts, and the default ready message. `subscribe` uses selector maps with `kind: "exact"` or `kind: "prefix"`. Multiple `intercept` entries are allowed only when they share the same priority; their selectors are merged into one registration because the harness supports one interceptor registration per extension connection.

`start(config)` is optional and runs once after `init` succeeds, subscriptions/intercepts are sent, `Ready` is sent, and host functions are registered. Use it for startup side effects such as `tau_info`; callback errors are reported as warning `harness.notice` diagnostics without disabling the extension.

`on_event(event, meta)` is optional and is called for delivered subscribed events. `meta.replay` is true for subscribe-time catch-up history, and `meta.recorded_at` is present when the harness supplies the event timestamp. Scripts with external side effects should skip replayed events.

`on_intercept(event)` is optional and returns one of:

- `()` / `"pass"` / `#{ kind: "pass" }` to pass the original event.
- `#{ kind: "pass", event: event }` to pass a replacement event.
- `"drop"` / `#{ kind: "drop" }` to drop the event.

On script errors or invalid intercept returns, Tau reports a warning `harness.notice` diagnostic and defaults to passing the original event.


## Host functions

`register_tool_group(name, spec)` and `register_tool(name, spec, handler)` are available during `init` only. Group specs must be empty in v1. Tool specs support `description`, `parameters`, `model_visible_name`, `enabled_by_default`, and `group`; undeclared groups referenced by a tool are auto-created as empty groups. Handlers are Rhai function pointers such as `Fn("my_tool")` and are called as `handler(args, call_info)` for live owned `tool.started` events. `call_info` contains `call_id`, `tool_name`, `agent_id`, `originator`, and `tool_type`. Replayed owned starts are ignored and owned starts are not also sent to raw `on_event`. Ownership is inferred from the harness-routed tool name because `tool.started` currently has no provider/extension owner field.

Shell results include `success`, `status`, `signal`, `timed_out`, `duration_seconds`, `termination_reason`, `output`, `truncated`, optional `total_lines`, optional `total_bytes`, and `valid_utf8`. Default timeout is 120 seconds and each extension may have at most 32 pending shell jobs.
Other host functions are available after `init` succeeds:

- `shell_spawn(command, opts)` executes a trusted host shell command asynchronously and returns a `ShellJob`. `opts` supports `timeout`, `cwd`, `on_complete`, and `tag`. Completion callbacks receive `(result, job)`. A tool handler returning `ShellJob` defers the tool result until the shell finishes; callback return values become `tool.result`, callback throws become `tool.error`, and no callback returns the full shell result map.
- `tau_emit(event)` emits a Tau event map.
- `tau_info(message)` and `tau_info(message, level)` emit `harness.notice`; `level` is `info`, `warning`, `debug`, or `trace` (`important` is accepted as a legacy spelling for `warning`).
- `tau_log(level, message)` writes only to extension logs.


## Safety and limitations

`std-rhai` runs trusted local scripts. Scripts can expose tools to agents and execute host shell commands through `shell_spawn`; shell execution is direct in `tau-ext-rhai` and intentionally does not use `tau-ext-shell` or its directory locks. Execution limits include `limits.max_operations`, `limits.max_call_levels`, and `limits.max_expr_depth`.

Event conversion supports the JSON-compatible subset of Tau payloads. Arbitrary CBOR bytes, tags, and non-string map keys are not faithfully represented yet.
