# tau-ext-xmpp architecture

`std-xmpp` is a disabled-by-default personal XMPP text bridge. It exposes only
`xmpp_register` and `xmpp_send`; the model never supplies arbitrary destination
JIDs. The extension does not connect to XMPP until an agent registers.

A single XMPP account may be used by multiple Tau processes concurrently because
this extension always requests a generated, high-entropy resource and then uses
the server-returned bound full JID.

The preferred routing mode is one MUC room per registered Tau agent id.
Registration waits up to 30 seconds for the initial XMPP online state,
joins the room, waits for exact `room/nick` self-presence, submits XEP-0045
instant-room owner config if status 201 reports a newly-created room, sends an
XEP-0045 mediated invite plus a direct fallback notice to the default recipient,
and leaves the room with unavailable presence on unregister or agent unload.
Room identity must remain stable and collision-resistant for registered routing
keys after XMPP JID normalization: the room localpart is
`<room_prefix>-<agent-slug>-<8-char-disambiguator>`. The slug is a short,
lowercase, localpart-safe hint derived from the Tau agent id; generated-looking
agent suffixes such as `-Y3KG` are omitted from the slug.
The disambiguator is a compact base32 encoding of a domain-separated BLAKE3 label
over the full validated `AgentId`, so truncated/readable slugs are not routing
authority. The short disambiguator is collision-resistant, not injective; before
joining, the worker rejects any normalized generated room already active or
pending for a different agent instead of overwriting
`room_to_agent`. Once MUC join presence is sent, the worker records pending
non-routable room/nick state until setup succeeds so timeout,
configuration failure, dropped registration response, unregister, or shutdown
can still send unavailable leave presence. Direct full-resource chat is
available as a portability fallback and accepts inbound messages only when the
stanza `to` exactly matches the current bound full JID. If reconnect binds a
different resource,
direct-resource registrations are updated and the default recipient is notified
of the new full JID. Existing MUC history is not requested on join, and
delayed/history stanzas are dropped if a server sends them anyway. The MVP
submits only the empty instant-room owner form needed to unlock newly-created
rooms; it does not fetch full configuration forms or submit affiliation IQs.
Deployments must use Prosody/server defaults or preconfiguration for private,
hidden, and members-only room policy.

The worker is the source of truth for XMPP connection readiness: an authenticated
tokio-xmpp `Online` event sets the current bound full JID, and `Disconnected`
clears it plus connection-scoped MUC occupant real-JID cache. `xmpp_register`
waits up to 30 seconds for readiness after starting the bridge before issuing
registration. `xmpp_send` waits up to 30 seconds only after the bridge has
already been started; startup remains registration-driven, and if no registered
conversation exists after readiness the tool still fails with the explicit
`xmpp_register(enabled: true)` requirement.

Incoming XMPP text is emitted as `extension.prompt_submit_request`. The harness
validates the target loaded agent and owns the durable prompt fact.
