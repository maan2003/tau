# tau-ext-xmpp security notes

- The built-in extension is disabled by default and requires an explicit
  password secret plus a non-empty `allowed_jids` allowlist.
- The MVP is plaintext XMPP message content protected only by TLS. It does not
  implement OMEMO or any other end-to-end encryption, so the XMPP server and its
  operator can read messages.
- TLS certificate validation is always enabled; there is no insecure plaintext
  transport option.
- The model cannot choose arbitrary recipients. `xmpp_send` sends only to the
  registered agent's configured conversation. MUC sends are visible to room
  occupants. MUC registration sends a mediated invite and a direct fallback
  notice only to the configured, allowlisted `default_recipient`.
- Messages from JIDs outside `allowed_jids` are ignored before routing.
- MUC mode requires real-JID visibility by default. If real JIDs are hidden, the
  extension fails closed unless `trust_muc_membership: true` is explicitly set.
  Tau submits instant-room configuration only to unlock newly-created rooms; it
  does not currently relax privacy settings or grant member affiliations.
  Deployments must enforce privacy and any members-only policy at the server or
  room-default layer.
- MUC room names include a readable agent slug plus a compact domain-separated
  BLAKE3 disambiguator derived from the full validated agent id. Distinct ids
  must remain collision-resistant after
  XMPP JID normalization, because a room collision would risk cross-agent prompt
  delivery; the readable slug is only a hint and is not the routing authority.
  If two generated room names ever collide in one process, registration fails
  closed instead of overwriting the existing room route.
- Text is treated as untrusted external input and is prefixed with XMPP source
  context before being submitted to Tau.
- Tau sends unavailable presence for MUC rooms on unregister and agent unload
  where the worker is still connected. After a successful MUC join,
  failures in invite/fallback notice delivery must still leave tracked state that
  can be cleaned up; server history/occupant policy remains a deployment
  concern.
