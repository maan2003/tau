# tau-cli-term-raw

Terminal prompt with async output support for tau.

## Rendering strategy

We render directly to the **normal terminal buffer** (no alternate screen).
This lets us use the terminal's native scrollback to preserve earlier output
that has scrolled off the top of the viewport. Three rendering paths handle
different situations, chosen by the redraw loop in `redraw_loop()`.

### Path 1 — Differential update (common case)

On each redraw the layout engine produces a flat list of `all_lines` covering
all content: history, live blocks, the prompt, and status zones. We slice the
last `height` lines as the visible viewport and pass them to
`Screen::update()`, which diffs against what was previously on the terminal and
emits only the escape sequences needed to update changed cells. This minimizes
terminal I/O — important over slow SSH connections.

Cursor movement is always relative (`MoveUp`, `\r`, `\n`, `MoveToColumn`) —
never absolute positioning. Downward movement uses `\n` rather than `MoveDown`
because `\n` scrolls the terminal when the cursor is at the bottom edge, while
`MoveDown` silently stops.

This diff approach is borrowed from fish shell's `screen.rs`.

### Path 2 — Scrolling render (overflow into scrollback)

When new content causes `visible_start` to increase (lines pushed off the top
of the viewport), a plain differential update would lose those lines — they
were rendered to the terminal previously but `Screen::update()` only knows
about the visible slice, so it can't push them into scrollback.

Instead, `Screen::render_scrolling()` diffs against the *full* content array
(not just the visible slice). It finds the first changed line and renders from
there downward using `\r\n` between lines. When `\r\n` is emitted while the
cursor is at the bottom terminal row, the terminal's native scroll mechanism
kicks in — the top screen row is pushed into the **scrollback buffer** and
everything shifts up. Because changed lines are rendered in top-to-bottom
order (overwriting their screen rows before they scroll off), the correct
content enters scrollback.

The key insight: scrollback is populated as a *side effect* of rendering, not
as a separate step. Content must be written to the terminal before it can
scroll into the scrollback buffer. This is why a simple "emit `\n` to scroll"
approach does not work — it would only push whatever happened to be on the
screen previously, not the new content.

This technique is borrowed from the
[Pi coding agent](https://github.com/ArtificialWisdomAI/pi-monorepo)'s TUI
renderer (`@mariozechner/pi-tui`), which renders lines sequentially and lets
`\r\n` at the viewport bottom push content into scrollback rather than
managing scrollback internally.

### Path 3 — Full render (resize)

On terminal resize or invalidation, `full_render()` clears the screen **and
scrollback** (`\x1b[2J\x1b[H\x1b[3J`), then outputs all no-rubber logical
lines from the top. Lines that overflow the viewport scroll into native
scrollback naturally, rebuilding history with the current width. Temporary
rubber is dropped, so if the transcript fits, the prompt sits directly under
content instead of being bottom-pinned by blank rows.

Scrollback is cleared on resize because the old scrollback contains lines
wrapped at the old terminal width. Replaying logical content produces correctly
reflowed scrollback for the new width.

## When mutations need a full redraw

The diff renderer (Path 1) only repaints the **visible viewport** — the last
`height` rows of `all_lines`. Anything above that lives in the terminal's
scrollback buffer and is unreachable by cursor positioning or differential
updates. Mutating a block whose rendered rows have scrolled into scrollback
without forcing a `full_render` leaves a *fossilized* copy in scrollback that
no longer matches the program's state.

The layout from top to bottom:

```
history          ← oldest, scrolls into scrollback first
above_active     ← live blocks (streaming responses, in-flight thinking)
above_sticky     ← pinned blocks (model status chip, queued user prompt)
input line       ← the prompt
suggestions      ← completion menu
below            ← anything below suggestions
```

Everything from `above_active` down is **bottom-anchored** — it sits at the
tail of `all_lines`, near the input cursor. As long as the bottom-anchored
zones fit in `height` rows, they are entirely inside the visible viewport and
the diff renderer can update them in place.

### Safe mutations (just call `TermHandle::redraw()`)

- Editing the input buffer or prompt.
- Updating the model status chip, suggestions, anything in `below`.
- `set_block` on a streaming live block in `above_active` — the most
  common case (response text appending, in-flight thinking growing,
  tool-progress updates).
- `print_output` of a brand-new block. The new block lands at the
  bottom of `all_lines`, so by definition it appears in the visible
  window when first emitted; its arrival may push earlier content into
  scrollback (Path 2), which is the natural way scrollback gets
  populated.

### Mutations that require `TermHandle::invalidate_screen()` (Path 3)

`invalidate_screen()` sets a flag that forces the next redraw through
`full_render` — clear screen + clear scrollback (`\x1b[2J\x1b[H\x1b[3J`),
then re-emit no-rubber `all_lines`. Use it for:

- **`set_block` on a block that may have scrolled out of the viewport.**
  Anything in `history`, including the most recent finalized block once
  later content has arrived. Examples: toggling diff expand/compact via
  `/show-diff`, hiding/showing thinking via `/show-thinking`.
- **Reordering the zone lists in a way that affects past rows.** A block
  that's still in `history` but has scrolled off can't be moved by
  `set_block` alone — diff render won't reach it.
- **Any geometry change.** Resize and `resume_after_external` already do
  this internally.

### The one edge case: live blocks larger than `height`

A live block in `above_active` can in theory grow taller than the visible
viewport. When that happens, its top rows have been written to the terminal
and scrolled into scrollback while its tail is still being updated. In-place
`set_block` updates only repaint the visible tail of the block; the
scrollback fossil is now stale.

This is currently invisible because streaming is **append-only**: text only
grows, characters are never retracted mid-stream, and `set_block` calls only
extend the tail. If we ever wanted retractable streaming or out-of-order
edits within a long live block, those updates would also need
`invalidate_screen()`.

## Known limitations

- **Resize clears pre-tau scrollback history.** Any terminal output from
  *before* tau started (shell commands, etc.) is lost on the first resize.
  Tau's own logical history is rebuilt by the full re-render, but the pre-tau
  scrollback cannot
  be recovered. This is an inherent trade-off of rendering to the normal
  terminal buffer without an alternate screen.

- **Content never displayed on screen cannot enter scrollback.** Path 2
  handles the common case where previously-visible lines scroll off. However,
  if a single update adds more new lines than the terminal height (e.g. a
  very long agent response arriving all at once), lines that were never
  on screen will not appear in scrollback. In practice this is rare because
  streaming responses grow incrementally.

## Layout zones

All content blocks are stored in a central map keyed by `BlockId`. Separate
ordered lists reference them for rendering (top to bottom):

1. **History** — persistent output (append-only).
2. **Above active** — mutable blocks (e.g. streaming responses).
3. **Above sticky** — blocks pinned right above the prompt.
4. **Input area** — left-prompt + user input + right-prompt.
5. **Suggestions** — completion menus below the prompt.
6. **Below** — status bars and other persistent bottom content.

## Threading model

Three threads cooperate:

- **Input reader** — blocks on `crossterm::event::read()`, forwards events to
  the downstream loop.
- **Redraw thread** — blocks on a coalescing notify channel, wakes up, reads
  shared state under a mutex, and renders via one of the three paths above.
- **Downstream event loop** — the caller's thread. Calls
  `Term::get_next_event()` which handles editing internally and surfaces
  high-level events.

Any thread holding a `TermHandle` can mutate zones and trigger a redraw.
Multiple redraws coalesce into one via the notify channel.
