## Design docs

- `README.md` — project overview, install, configuration, and contact info
- `FEATURES.md` — major feature tour; update after editing any new major features
- `SECURITY.md` — project-wide security/reliability context and trust boundaries;
  MUST read before changing or reviewing runtime behavior, persistence,
  extension/harness boundaries, tools, or other security/reliability-sensitive code
- `docs/` — focused design and feature notes
- `crates/*/README.md` — crate-specific documentation where present
- `crates/*/ARCHITECTURE.md` — crate-specific architecture notes where present; MUST read before changing that crate
- `crates/*/AGENTS.md` — crate-specific agent instructions - MUST read these (if exists) before modifing code in a given crate

## Common commands

- `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` or `just check` — check Rust code
- `cargo nextest run` or `just test` — run tests
- `treefmt` or `just format` — format code
- `selfci check --candidate <change-id>` — full local CI verification for an explicit candidate change; WARNING: slow, but independent of working copy state, so it can run safely in parallel, and working copy files can be modified without affecting it; prefer to run in parallel and/or only as a final verification step

## Definition of done

- `selfci check --candidate <change-id>` (CI) passes
- Update `FEATURES.md` after editing any new major features.

## Rules

- This project is still very immuture and backward compatibility is never needed.
- ALWAYS consult `tau-commit` skill before making commits
- When asked to debug Tau runs, agents, daemon state, or event logs, read `tau-self-knowledge-debugging` skill
- Extension configuration errors must never be silent. Extensions that fail to parse or apply their `Configure.config` MUST send `HarnessInputMessage::ConfigError`; the harness MUST surface those as mandatory `harness.notice` and replay them to late UI subscribers.
